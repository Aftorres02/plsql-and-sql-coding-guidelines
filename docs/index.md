In the I.T. world of today, robust and secure applications are becoming more and more important. Many business processes no longer work without I.T. and the dependence of businesses on their I.T. has grown tremendously, meaning we need robust and maintainable applications. An important requirement is to have standards and guidelines, which make it possible to maintain source code created by a number of people quickly and easily. This forms the basis of well functioning off- or on-shoring strategy, as it allows quality assurance to be carried out efficiently at the source. 

Good standards and guidelines are based on the wealth of experience and knowledge gained from past (and future?) problems, such as those, which can arise in a cloud environment, for example.<br/>

The Oracle Database Developer community is made stronger by resources freely shared by experts around the world, such as the Trivadis Coding Guidelines. If you have not yet adopted standards for writing SQL and PL/SQL in your applications, this is a great place to start.<br/><br/><br/>

It is a matter of fact, that code is more often read than written â€“ therefore we should take efforts to ease the work of the reader, which is not necessarily the author.

I am convinced that this standard may be a good starting point for your own guidelines.<br/><br/>
