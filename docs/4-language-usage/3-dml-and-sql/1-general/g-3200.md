# G-3200: Never use an ON clause when USING will work.

!!! warning "Minor"
    Maintainability

## Reason

An `on` clause requires more code than a `using` clause and presents a greater possibility for making errors. The `using` clause is easier to read and maintain.

Note that the `using` clause prevents the use of a table alias for the join column in any of the other clauses of the sql statement. 

## Example (bad)

```sql
select e.deparment_id
      ,d.department_name 
      ,e.last_name 
      ,e.first_name 
  from employee e join department d on (e.department_id = d.department_id);
```

## Example (good)

```sql
select   department_id
       d.department_name 
      ,e.last_name 
      ,e.first_name 
  from employee e join department d using (department_id);
```
